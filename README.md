# Basic-Pytorch-LSTM-Program
This is a very basic beginners version of a text prediction model, made in python using Pytorch.

Essentially, you store the data in a text file (data.txt is hardcoded into it right now), change any parameters in the code that you want such as epoch count, and run the program. It will tokenize the data and initialize a model, then train the model on the provided data and save it. After it is trained, you can submit requests to the trained model.

You will need pytorch and python installed on your computer to use this. I apologize if that is annoying but I am very new to uploading my projects to Github, and hope to improve quickly.
